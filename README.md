# Free-Hand Sketch Recognition

This project is about classifying free-hand sketches using a machine learning model. The goal is to accurately identify the object that a sketch represents.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of 20,000 free-hand sketches, each labeled with the object it represents. Dataset can be found [here](https://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/projects/classifysketch/).

## Model

The model used in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is particularly effective for image classification tasks. The model is trained using the training dataset and its performance is evaluated using the validation dataset.
